# LocalML
Local/Offline Machine Learning Resources

This repo is intended to be catalog of local, offline, and open-source machine learning (ML) tools and approaches, for enhancing community-centered connectivity and education, particularly in underconnected regions and low-resource contexts.

If your objective is machine learning/AI without internet, on a standard consumer laptop or desktop PC, or phone, there should be useful resources for you in this repository.

We will attempt to label any closed source tools as such.   

The Main list of tools can be found here: https://github.com/Wakoma/LocalML/blob/main/resources/tools.md.

The shared Zotero Library for this project can be found here: https://www.zotero.org/groups/5718368/localml/library
