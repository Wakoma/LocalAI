# Zotero Test



“The type of documentation required by the original designers of hardware to assemble it themselves is very different from the type of documentation required for distributed manufacturing at scale. Documentation can range from simple schematics to detailed assembly instructions and testing protocols. A distribution project should assess the type of documentation its intended structure requires, including assembly instructions, user manuals, and troubleshooting guides. If ongoing maintenance and improvement of the design will be taken on by someone other than the original designers, documentation of the design rationale, software toolchain, and planned or partially implemented features may also be needed.” ([“Distributed Manufacturing of Open Hardware”, p. 19](zotero://select/groups/5586088/items/GWEP8BNQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5586088/items/ETCQKAXX?page=19&annotation=SICQSICT))
