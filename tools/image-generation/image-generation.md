## Fooocus

Fooocus presents a rethinking of image generator designs. The software is offline, open source, and free, while at the same time, similar to many online image generators like Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images. Fooocus has also simplified the installation: between pressing "download" and generating the first image, the number of needed mouse clicks is strictly limited to less than 3. Minimal GPU memory requirement is 4GB (Nvidia).

## Generative AI for Krita

https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion

This is a plugin to use generative AI in image painting and editing workflows from within Krita. For a more visual introduction, see www.interstice.cloud

The main goals of this project are:

    Precision and Control. Creating entire images from text can be unpredictable. To get the result you envision, you can restrict generation to selections, refine existing content with a variable degree of strength, focus text on image regions, and guide generation with reference images, sketches, line art, depth maps, and more.
    Workflow Integration. Most image generation tools focus heavily on AI parameters. This project aims to be an unobtrusive tool that integrates and synergizes with image editing workflows in Krita. Draw, paint, edit and generate seamlessly without worrying about resolution and technical details.
    Local, Open, Free. We are committed to open source models. Customize presets, bring your own models, and run everything local on your hardware. Cloud generation is also available to get started quickly without heavy investment.
