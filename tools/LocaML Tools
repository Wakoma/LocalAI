## Ollama

ollama.com

https://github.com/ollama/ollama

Get up and running with Llama 3.2, Mistral, Gemma 2, and other large language models. 


## GPT4All

nomic.ai/gpt4all

https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all

 GPT4All runs large language models (LLMs) privately on everyday desktops & laptops.

No API calls or GPUs required - you can just download the application and get started. 



## Llama.cpp

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp

Inference of Meta's LLaMA model (and others) in pure C/C++

The main goal of llama.cpp is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

    Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
    Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
    AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
    1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use
    Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads MTT GPUs via MUSA)
    Vulkan and SYCL backend support
    CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity

Since its inception, the project has improved significantly thanks to many contributions. It is the main playground for developing new features for the ggml library.

## koboldcpp

KoboldCpp is an easy-to-use AI text-generation software for GGML and GGUF models, inspired by the original KoboldAI. It's a single self-contained distributable from Concedo, that builds off llama.cpp, and adds a versatile KoboldAI API endpoint, additional format support, Stable Diffusion image generation, speech-to-text, backward compatibility, as well as a fancy UI with persistent stories, editing tools, save formats, memory, world info, author's note, characters, scenarios and everything KoboldAI and KoboldAI Lite have to offer.

## Fooocus

Fooocus presents a rethinking of image generator designs. The software is offline, open source, and free, while at the same time, similar to many online image generators like Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images. Fooocus has also simplified the installation: between pressing "download" and generating the first image, the number of needed mouse clicks is strictly limited to less than 3. Minimal GPU memory requirement is 4GB (Nvidia).

## Generative AI for Krita

https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion

This is a plugin to use generative AI in image painting and editing workflows from within Krita. For a more visual introduction, see www.interstice.cloud

The main goals of this project are:

    Precision and Control. Creating entire images from text can be unpredictable. To get the result you envision, you can restrict generation to selections, refine existing content with a variable degree of strength, focus text on image regions, and guide generation with reference images, sketches, line art, depth maps, and more.
    Workflow Integration. Most image generation tools focus heavily on AI parameters. This project aims to be an unobtrusive tool that integrates and synergizes with image editing workflows in Krita. Draw, paint, edit and generate seamlessly without worrying about resolution and technical details.
    Local, Open, Free. We are committed to open source models. Customize presets, bring your own models, and run everything local on your hardware. Cloud generation is also available to get started quickly without heavy investment.
